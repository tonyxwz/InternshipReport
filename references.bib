	abstract = {Magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a noninvasive thermal technique that enables rapid heating of a specific area in the human body. Its clinical relevance has been proven for the treatments of soft tissue tumors, like uterine fibroids, and for the treatments of solid tumors in bone. In MR-HIFU treatment, MR-thermometry is used to monitor the temperature evolution in soft tissue. However, this technique is currently unavailable for bone tissue. Computer models can play a key role in the accurate prediction and monitoring of temperature. Here, we present a computer ray tracing model that calculates the heat production density in the focal region. This model accounts for both the propagation of shear waves and the interference between longitudinal and shear waves. The model was first compared with a finite element approach which solves the Helmholtz equation in soft tissue and the frequency-domain wave equation in bone. To obtain the temperature evolution in the focal region, the heat equation was solved using the heat production density generated by the raytracer as a heat source. Then, we investigated the role of the interaction between shear and longitudinal waves in terms of dissipated power and temperature output. The results of our model were in agreement with the results obtained by solving the Helmholtz equation and the frequency-domain wave equation, both in soft tissue and bone. Our results suggest that it is imperative to include both shear waves and their interference with longitudinal waves in the model when simulating high intensity focused ultrasound propagation in solids. In fact, when modeling HIFU treatments, omitting the interference between shear and longitudinal waves leads to an over-estimation of the temperature increase in the tissues.}

  abstract = "In the past two decades, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in combination with diagnostic ultrasound (USgFUS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRgFUS) opened new ways of therapeutic access to a multitude of pathologic conditions. The therapeutic potential of HIFU lies in the fact that it enables the localized deposition of high-energy doses deep within the human body without harming the surrounding tissue. The addition of diagnostic ultrasound or in particular MRI with HIFU allows for planning, control and direct monitoring of the treatment process. The clinical and preclinical applications of HIFU range from the thermal treatment of benign and malign lesions, targeted drug delivery, to the treatment of thrombi (sonothrombolysis). Especially the therapy of prostate cancer under US-guidance and the ablation of benign uterine fibroids under MRI monitoring are now therapy options available to a larger number of patients. The main challenges for an abdominal application of HIFU are posed by partial or full occlusion of the target site by bones or air filled structures (e.g. colon), as well as organ motion. In non-trivial cases, the implementation of computer based modeling, simulation and optimization is desirable. This article describes the principles of HIFU, ultrasound and MRI therapy guidance, therapy planning and simulation, and gives an overview of the current and potential future applications.
  Zusammenfassung
  Hochenergetischer fokussierter Ultraschall (HIFU) appliziert unter US-diagnostischer (USgFUS) oder Magnetresonanz-tomographischer (MRgFUS) Kontrolle hat in den letzen 20 Jahren neuartige therapeutische Ansätze für eine Vielzahl von Erkrankungen geschaffen. Das therapeutische Potential von HIFU besteht darin, dass hohe Mengen Energie sehr lokalisiert in der Tiefe des menschlichen Körpers appliziert werden können ohne dabei die umgebenden Strukturen zu schädigen. Die Kombination mit der Ultraschall- und insbesondere der MR-Bildgebung erlaubt die Planung, Kontrolle und das direkte Monitoring des Behandlungsfortschritts. Die Anwendungen von HIFU reichen von der thermischen Behandlung benigner und maligner Läsionen über die gezielte Verabreichung von Medikamenten (targeted drug delivery) bis hin zur Behandlung von Thrombosen (Sonothrombolyse). So stehen nun mit der Therapie des Prostatakarzinoms unter US-Kontrolle und der Ablation von Uterusmyomen unter MRT-Kontrolle zwei HIFU-Therapiemodalitäten einer größeren Patientenzahl zur Verfügung. Eine große Herausforderung bleibt die Therapie abdomineller Organe die sich einerseits bewegen und andererseits durch Knochen oder luftgefüllte Strukturen, wie den Darm, partiell oder total verdeckt werden. Für solche Fälle wird die Kombination mit anderen bildgebenden Verfahren und Computerunterstützung zur Modellierung, Simulation und Optimierung in der Planung und Durchführung der HIFU-Behandlung untersucht. Der Artikel beschreibt die Grundlagen von HIFU, die Therapieüberwachung mit diagnostischem Ultraschall und MRT, die Therapieplanung und die Simulation. Zudem wird ein Überblick der aktuellen und in Zukunft möglichen Anwendungen gegeben."

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) has been clinically shown to be effective for palliative pain management in patients suffering from skeletal metastasis. The underlying mechanism is supposed to be periosteal denervation caused by ablative temperatures reached through ultrasound heating of the cortex. The challenge is exact temperature control during sonication as MR-based thermometry approaches for bone tissue are currently not available. Thus, in contrast to the MR-HIFU ablation of soft tissue, a thermometry feedback to the HIFU is lacking, and the treatment of bone metastasis is entirely based on temperature information acquired in the soft tissue adjacent to the bone surface. However, heating of the adjacent tissue depends on the exact sonication protocol and requires extensive modelling to estimate the actual temperature of the cortex. Here we develop a computational model to calculate the spatial temperature evolution in bone and the adjacent tissue during sonication. First, a ray-tracing technique is used to compute the heat production in each spatial point serving as a source term for the second part, where the actual temperature is calculated as a function of space and time by solving the Pennes bio-heat equation. Importantly, our model includes shear waves that arise at the bone interface as well as all geometrical considerations of transducer and bone geometry. The model was compared with a theoretical approach based on the far field approximation and an MR-HIFU experiment using a bone phantom. Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of shear waves to the heat production and resulting temperatures in bone. The temperature evolution predicted by our model was in accordance with the far field approximation and agreed well with the experimental data obtained in phantoms. Our model allows the simulation of the HIFU treatments of bone metastasis in patients and can be extended to a planning tool prior to MR-HIFU treatments.}
